# Error details

```
Error: "context" and "page" fixtures are not supported in "beforeAll" since they are created on a per-test basis.
If you would like to reuse a single page between tests, create context manually with browser.newContext(). See https://aka.ms/playwright/reuse-page for details.
If you would like to configure your page before each test, do that in beforeEach hook instead.
